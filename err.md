I downloaded your project and was able to successfully install it on an emulator without it crashing.  It did crash after I clicked save when adding an item though.  You mention that the app immediately crashes.  Are you saying that it never shows anything and just crashes right after Android Studio installs it?

Did you run it before successfully then added a table or had a typo in the database creation? You can try deleting the database data from your emulator and then re run it if thatâ€™s the case

You can set up an upgrade policy to delete the db and then simply increase the version number to clear your old database. This works well for rapid iterations. (edited)

Steven, how do I do that?


steven.b [5 days ago]
Your overridden SqliteDbHelper has an onUpgrade method. Just uncomment it and add the constant String with the "DROP TABLES" sql command.


steven.b [5 days ago]
Your constructor passes your database version into the super constructor. When you change the version it will run the onUpgrade method on its own (edited)
